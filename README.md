# ILID
This work "How to Leverage Diverse Demonstrations in Offline Imitation Learning" has been accepted by ICML'24.
## :page_facing_up: Description
we introduce a simple yet effective data selection method that identifies positive behaviors based on their \emph{resultant states} -- a more informative criterion enabling explicit utilization of dynamics information and effective extraction of both expert and beneficial diverse behaviors. Further, we devise a lightweight behavior cloning algorithm capable of leveraging the expert and selected data correctly. In the experiments, we evaluate our method on a suite of complex and high-dimensional offline IL benchmarks, including continuous-control and vision-based tasks. The results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods on \textbf{20/21} benchmarks, typically by \textbf{2-5x}, while maintaining a comparable runtime to Behavior Cloning (\texttt{BC}).
